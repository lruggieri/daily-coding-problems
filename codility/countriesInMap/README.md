Count the number of different countries that a map contains.

```
1  1  1
1  2  1
2  3  3
```

a country is group of neighbouring cells. A cell is a neighbour of another one
if they are next to each other orthogonally (meaning north, south, east and west) and they have the same value.

The above example should yield 4.
