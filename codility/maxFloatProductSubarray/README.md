Find the max sub-product of an input array of floats.
A sub-product is the product of a contiguous number of array elements.
Each element is bounded between -10000.0 and +10000.0.

Eg.
* \[0.1, -1, -2, 0.7\] ==> 2, given by the subarray \[1,2\]
* \[0.1, -1, 0.7\] ==> 0.7, given by the subarray \[2\]
